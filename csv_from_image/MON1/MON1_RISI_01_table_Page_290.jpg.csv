Table: Table_1

X During art class kept making sexual comments and gestures.. when I asked to give me back the yardstick he took off of the back table he refused to do so. He made comments that sounded like he was calling someone a Homo or no homo and I told him to stop and that it was rude. I do not know who he was referring to. Then while he seemed to be working (and everyone else was) he suddenly opened up the back door to my classroom and pushed down paper, supplies and a bin of tempera paint on the ground that i had on my prep station, and when i asked him to stop he told me Fuck you or Fuck off and then he grabbed the yardstick and broke it. Support in room went after him but then came back to call for support when they could not find him. ,,
