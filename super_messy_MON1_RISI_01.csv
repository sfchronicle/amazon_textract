3237,open my office door me as well as another CI witnessed Michael,,,,,,
3238,punch another student multiple times. We immediately intervened,,,,,,
3239,and put him in a restraint he kept saying let me up and we told him if,,,,,,
3240,he can be calm and safe we would eventually he did calm down so we,,,,,,
3241,let him go. I then took him to the nurses office so he could be treated,,,,,,
3242,because he was bleeding from a prior sore he had. He was treated,,,,,,
3243,and left the nurses office I followed closely behind because he said he,,,,,,
3244,wanted to get his bike and leave. So when we got to the class where,,,,,,
3245,his bike was his bike wasn't operable so he started asking what,,,,,,
3246,happened to his bike and left the class angry so he started looking for,,,,,,
3247,another student saying where is he I'm bout to kick his ass. I,,,,,,
3248,continued to follow him as he started looking in every classroom,,,,,,
3249,around the building. As we headed over to building 9 he looked in one,,,,,,
3250,of the classrooms and he saw the student he was looking for so the,,,,,,
3251,teacher opened the door he tried to rush in and go after the student,,,,,,
3252,but I was able to grab him and hold him up against the wall until the,,,,,,
3253,teacher could get the student out of the room. After the student left,,,,,,
3254,Michael wanted to leave the room so I let him out and he,,,,,,
3255,immediately tried to go after the other student but once again I,,,,,,
3256,subdued him and he got even more agitated. So I was talking to him,,,,,,
3257,he then appeared calm so as I got a little laxed he ran towards me and,,,,,,
3258,I was unsuccessful when I tried to grab him. Michael ran through the,,,,,,
3259,chute after the other student but in the process knocked down,,,,,,

3275,"not letting them search me fuck that"" However, he walked right to the",,,,,,
3276,nurses office and waited with me until she returned. A CI and a,,,,,,
3277,security officer entered either at the same time as the nurse or,,,,,,

3280,about not wanting to be searched again and that they haven't found,,,,,,
3281,anything and they need to stop going after him and searching him. He,,,,,,
